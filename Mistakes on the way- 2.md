The biggest mistake I done was trust too much on the AI tool and just wish that they will automated everything doing this almost automatic for me, this cause me a lot of trouble in the process of learning.
When I open the arctestnet docs, there was a lot of codes and features that i don't understand nothing, and just copy and paste on chat the main link for deploy contract just wishing that they will do everything for me.
The first mistake happens when chat gpt ask for install the hardhat feature, Foundry was the right one, this was a mistake done by artificial inteligence but also by me that didn't read the instructions very well.
Well this ends very well hours of coding testing testing and obvius nothing works, the commands didn't work, by the way you can find the whole process here inside https://docs.arc.network/arc/tutorials/deploy-on-arc de arctestnets docs.
But this was helpfull for understanding the flow of this path
