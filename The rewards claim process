After deployng your intmac block builder, when you want to claim your rewards from that, it's not automatic.
You need to go ahead to https://docs.network.intmax.io/developers-hub/intmax-block-builder/receive-rewards and take a deep look of what you will need to do
The good part you can run this in any place, don1t need to be inside your block builder vps , in my case, you will just need your backupe private key for acessing you wallet 
( stands out for the help fromm the team from help me to find this, toke a while but the guys inside the discord guide me about the claimming rewards)
So first of all you will need to generate a ITX wallet and your private key of your Intmax wallet will be sended for you after you run the cargo command
But i recomend to after start to deploy everything, just go ahead at alchemy and create and acount and generate an APY key for your personal use, you will need to use this inside the nano .env file you will creat
I think this was the most confusing part for me an very new, have no idea of the possibility of doing this
