So i been running my main block builder for at least 15 days and the results in my perspective is very nice
After sharing my results,I want to make clear that my idea here is not earn real money in fees by the users, first because the gwei is not high anymore, as it was before.
So everything is very cheap of doing in the mainnet today, and also create a probleam for a lot of L2 that is here with no real purpose of building, and just want to make everything cheaper.
For running an mining in the tradicional UI with lower fees is very very cheap
For running this with the block builder is even more cheap and you can run this paralel you don't need to do the whole process of deposit nd withdraw your assets, so everything is automatic 
What I'm searching here running this, is acummulate the most ITX tokens i can after the oficial lauch spending the less possible, this is my main goal 
So I have an account with more than 150k ITX tokens done directly by minning in the tradicional UI and I have spended more than $150 and have paied very high fees when the gewi was more expensive, around 2~5 dollars per minning seasion with more than 70 deposits and withdraws
With my block builder the spending on this is almost and zero, the fees is very low coast, folowing the oficial docs by intmax "The Block Builder collects a fee of $0.005 per user per transaction. For each block, it can accumulate up to $0.005 × 128 in fees"
So very cheap process and and acummulating around 500~700 per week running this automatic with and vos systeam, so monthy im expecting around 2000 sITX rewards, so very positive in my view for just letting this running by itself
Some data that migh interest you guys, when checking the intmax explorer ( you can also check this here https://explorer.intmax.io/) 
This shows that in the day of this post has around 240 blcok builders,so there is 240 diferent adress out there running this block builder, very fell.
Compared to more than 14k adress wunning this in the tradcional UI, so i think the competitive here still very low and very positive, 
The most likely explanation for me to this less people running the block builder is the infrastructure barrier to entry with codding most people don't want to follow this path.
In the fees area, right now i still haven't colected any relevant fee , but also haven't spend any signifcant amount of money, so for me it's being a positive experience
By the way I forgot to talke about a fix coast that i have , the vps signature paud montly, so i spend around 5 dollares per one vps directly paid in my bank account, so yeah I'm having a coast of 5 dollars plus the fees spended with the block builder that is irrelevant.
