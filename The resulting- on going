So i been running my main block builder for at least 15 days and the results in my perspective is very nice
After sharing my results,I want to make clear that my idea here is not earn real money in fees by the users, first because the gwei is not high anymore, as it was before.
So everything is very cheap of doing in the mainnet today, and also create a probleam for a lot of L2 that is here with no real purpose of building, and just want to make everything cheaper.
For running an mining in the tradicional UI with lower fees is very very cheap
For running this with the block builder is even more cheap and you can run this paralel you don't need to do the whole process of deposit nd withdraw your assets, so everything is automatic 
What I'm searching here running this, is acummulate the most ITX tokens i can after the oficial lauch
