So after talking to chat gpt and making clear what was my plan with building a intmax block builder, they advise me for going to a vpn
It was better for logical things, first works 24hours,second works paralel form my computer so its the best of the words
After some research I follow up with the contabo VPN, 
The intmax block builder requires very low ussage sow the basic plan attends ver well
There is 2 ways of deploys the intmax block builder 
Standalone
Full netword
By the way
Recommended Configuration:
2 vCPU
4 GB RAM
10 GB SSD
This is the recomendation configuration, so very basics
I decide to go with the standalonne mode first, thinking that was much easier, and I wasn't able to deploy de builder.
I found the erros on the logs that the https wsa the reason for this error, i tried a lot of stuff, the heartbeat was being emitting on the explorer of scroll
