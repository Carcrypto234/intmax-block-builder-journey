Reading the Intmax docs, I realize that it was necessary around 0.01ETH to cover the gas ussage in the operation of the block builder
Doing this you will earn some rewards on sITX (scroll Intmax minning asset) and some users fees
Comparing this to the normal ussage of the standard UI of the website 
Block Builder - 0.01ETH ( around $30/40$~) 
Standard mining 0.1
