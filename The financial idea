Reading the Intmax docs, I realize that it was necessary around 0.01ETH to cover the gas ussage in the operation of the block builder
Doing this you will earn some rewards on sITX (scroll Intmax minning asset) and some users fees
Comparing this to the normal ussage of the standard UI of the website
Block Builder - 0.01ETH ( around $30/40$~) daily rewards in sITX and users fees 
Standard mining -  0.1ETH (around $300~) around 500 ITX per mining in a cycle of 2-5 days ( this was done after the upgrade of rewards and emission of ITX)
The biggest question was how many sITX this will make me of rewards compared to the standard mining
So i packed a wallet with 0.01ETH on a new navigator
Sign a basic plan on contabo for VPS 
In financial terms is was a very cheap experience for mining some tokens from a insteresting protocol that is very align with privacy
