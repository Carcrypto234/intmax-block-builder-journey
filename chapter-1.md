# Chapter 1 – A Journey Into AI-Assisted Programming

My first day trying to build something using programming started with a simple idea: deploying a block builder on a testnet.

The first attempt was made on the ARC testnet. What initially seemed simple turned into a real learning challenge. The entire process took around two days to complete.

During this time, I had to install and understand several tools and environments, including:

- Visual Studio Code
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- PowerShell
- Basic command-line usage
- Integration of Ubuntu with VS Code (WSL)

This phase taught me that infrastructure work is not only about code, but also about understanding operating systems, environments, and how different tools communicate with each other.

Although the goal was a deploy, the real achievement was building a foundation to keep learning.
