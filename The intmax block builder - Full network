This was was soft and easy, i think because of all the simple but honest background that i pick up tryng everything ans making things works
This one was very easy and very simple 
They already give you the full version automatic , just need to dowload the docker, applyng the setup script.
adding the intmax repositor
And then following the guide already provide by running the command ./builder.sh setup-env
This will do everythig for you and in less than 10 minutes everything should be running very nice
The beauty if this way of deployg , is how simples this is
I think that even a complete begginer with no skills at all should be able to run this very easy, just opening the ubuntu app copy and paste all the commands already provide by the team
This person probabily will be able to run everything very easy
This is very positive because open doors for everyone that want to be more integrated with the intmax ecosysteam and really believe in the path they are building inside the privacy word of crypto.
