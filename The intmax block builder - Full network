They already give you the full version automatic , just need to dowload the docker, applyng the setup script.
adding the intmax repositor
And then following the guide already provide by running the command ./builder.sh setup-env
This will do everythig for you and in less than 10 minutes everything should be running very nice
The beauty if this way of deployg , is how simples this is
