Daily programming learning journal documenting my journey until successfully deploying an INTMAX Block Builder.
# INTMAX Block Builder Journey

This repository documents my learning journey deploying and understanding the INTMAX Block Builder infrastructure.

The goal is to openly share challenges, mistakes, tools, and lessons learned while working with Web3 infrastructure, Linux environments, and AI-assisted programming.

This is a public learning diary and open-source documentation project.

# Peace to all
