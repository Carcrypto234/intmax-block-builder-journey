So after talking to chat gpt and making clear what was my plan with building a intmax block builder, they advise me for going to a vpn
It was better for logical things, first works 24hours,second works paralel form my computer so its the best of the words
After some research I follow up with the contabo VPN, 
The intmax block builder requires very low ussage sow the basic plan attends ver well
There is 2 ways of deploys the intmax block builder 
Standalone
Full netword
By the way
Recommended Configuration:
2 vCPU
4 GB RAM
10 GB SSD
This is the recomendation configuration, so very basics
I decide to go with the standalonne mode first, thinking that was much easier, and I wasn't able to deploy de builder.
My first mistake, i give the wrong private key with a wallet with no funds, i made that mistake, and took me a while to find the error
In coding this is very intersting you took a while unitl you find the real reason why something is not working ans sometimes it's a very idiot, lol.
After that my explorer start to emmit a heartbeat sign but with no registration yet
Then searching in the log looks like that was some error 
I found my  the erros on the logs that the https was the reason for this error, i tried a lot of stuff, the heartbeat was being emitting on the explorer of scrol
But the regristration was not done.
Unfortally even the IA features I wasn't able to find what was wrong with that
But this bring a valueble knoagdle start to read all the dcoumentation to deploy everything as the team point for. 
The probleam of this is, without the background knodagle, chat gpt didn't help me with all my probleams.
After studdyng a lot the team docs i discover that the probleam that I was facing was realated with my HTTP and my VPS server
I tried to runn this with my personal computer and everything runned normal.
The big stuff with the standalone mode is the more detailed systeam that you need to build with nano .env 
But in resume, is not difficult at all you just need to adjust the nano .env file with you own 
Then reading the docs I found the full network way for deployng the block builder and decided to try it
