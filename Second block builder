After thinking about how much I was receiving with the sITX rewards with almost zero coast very very low txs from intmax,
"The Block Builder collects a fee of $0.005 per user per transaction" - from the reference https://docs.network.intmax.io/developers-hub/intmax-block-builder/full-netwrok#key-features
So almost coast zero with less money needed on the game,probabily because of the tecnical stuff needed 
The tradicional mining systeam give you directly ITX token, so sITX can have  will others unlocking feature maybe o nthe feature with the token on the marker, but impossible to know,and time will tell
