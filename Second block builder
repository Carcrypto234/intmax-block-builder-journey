After thinking about how much I was receiving with the sITX rewards with almost zero coast very very low txs from intmax,
"The Block Builder collects a fee of $0.005 per user per transaction" - from the reference https://docs.network.intmax.io/developers-hub/intmax-block-builder/full-netwrok#key-features
So almost coast zero with less money needed on the game, just some coding
